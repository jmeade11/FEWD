# Class 10 Materials

Today, we learn about variables and while we're at it, we're going to about data types in Javascript.  Additionally, we'll be talking about effects methods, the `this` keyword, chaining methods and methods as both setters and getters.

## Objectives

By the end of class, you should be able to:

<ul>
  <li>Use jQuery to add effects and animation</li>
  <li>Create and use variables to store strings, numbers and boolean values</li>
  <li>Use jQuery methods as both a getter and setter</li>
  <li>Chain methods to write more efficient code</li>
  <li>Understand and use the Javascript keyword
      <strong>this</strong>&nbsp;
  </li>
</ul>

## Homework

Now that we've started the Javascript portion of our curriculum, your final projects will take centerstage in your homework assignments.  **Work on your designs this weekend.**

Make sure you're in a position to have your HTML and CSS done by week 7 (which happens to be a short week)!
