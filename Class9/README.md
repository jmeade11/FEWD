# Class 9 Materials

Today, we begin working with Javascript, and specifically jQuery.  As we move into this part of the course curriculum, you'll be learning more about computer science â€” which I like to think of as learning how to *think* like a computer.  Each week from here out, you'll also be focused on taking specific steps toward completing your final projects.

## Objectives

Now that you have a good, strong foundation in both HTML and CSS, we can leverage that knowledge to learn Javascript.  Of the primary web technologies every front end web developer must know, Javascript is the final piece of the puzzle.  With it, we can respond to external input caused by the user interacting with the page.  Class 8 is a gentle introduction to jQuery; what it is and its basic syntax.  By the end of class, you should:

<ul>
  <li>Have an understanding of what jQuery is and why we use it.</li>
  <li>Use the proper jQuery syntax to construct basic statements to add, remove and toggle classes dynamically through Javascript.</li>
  <li>Be able to distinguish between strings, numbers and boolean values.</li>
  <li>Understand what 'this' is and how it can be used to write more optimized code.</li>
</ul>

## What You Learned about HTML & CSS

We've covered so much in just a few weeks about HTML and CSS.  We'll still get lots of practice with both in the upcoming weeks, but make sure you perodically reflect on these topics, as they are core to your ability to complete your final projects:

<ul>

  <li>Apply transforms using :active, :hover and :checked pseudo classes</li>
  <li>Apply CSS transitions to smoothly transition changes</li>
  <li>Understand which values are animatable</li>
