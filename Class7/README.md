# Class 7 Materials

As we wrap up HTML and CSS, we're covering CSS transitions and animations.  These are a perfect segue into Javascript, as we'll be frequently using it to transition elements on and off the page.  In fact, our next project together will form the basis for our first class in Javascript and we'll be relying on some of our new found skills to make it look good.
